# Movie-Recommendation-App

The purpose of this program is to present some techniques of movie recommendation systems used, among others, by streaming services with the help of collaborative filtering, thus using similarities between users and not features of a given product - in this case a movie.
In the first version of the program, the similarity between users (friends) was calculated using Pearson Correlation score which is one of the memory based methods. It is planned that one of the model based methods will be implemented for comparison.
